# Game-Scripts
Hello all, these are the scripts for my first unity game, I have been following some tutorials for the basics and expanding from there to add what I need for the game.
In the spirt of furthing learning you can use these scripts for whatever you like, you dont have to attribute me but I would apreciate it none the less.

Props to both Brackeys and Hundred Fire Games for a lot of the base scripts and showing me how to use unity.
