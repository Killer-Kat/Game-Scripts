# Game-Scripts
Hello all, these are the scripts for my first unity game "A ballad of Unity, The decent into discordâ€™s shadow", I have been following some tutorials for the basics and expanding from there to add what I need for the game at this point the majority of the scripts and code are my own.
In the spirt of furthing learning you can use these scripts for whatever you like, you dont have to attribute me but I would apreciate it none the less.

Props to both Brackeys and Hundred Fire Games (and every single C++ C# C or Unity tutorial out there at this point) for a lot of the base scripts and showing me how to use unity.

And if you have any questions about how a script works let me know, i'll be happy to guide you through it.
